# üì∞ Project description

This repository is still a work in progress. The goal is to create an 'Escape From Tarkov'-like game mode in Garry's Mod.
I'm working on this project in my free time, which I don't have much of.

- **Escape From Tarkov** is a hardcore survival first-person shooter that I really enjoy.
- **Garry's Mod** is a sandbox game where you can code your own scripts.
