# ðŸ“° Project description

This repository is still work in progress. The goal is to create a Escape From Tarkov* like gamemode on Garry's mod*.
I work on this project on my free time (I don't have a lot).

- Escape From Tarkov is a hardcore surival FPS and I really enjoy this game.
- Garry's mod is a sandbox game where you can code your own script.
